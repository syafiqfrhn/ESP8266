Create a new new script inside the current spreadsheet. The *Code.gs* needs to be inserted into the script.

Note that despite using the same spreadsheet, the *Script Projects* for *Communication Unit* **needs to be a separate project** from *Output & Database*.

Also, note that Google HTML Service only accepts HTML and Google Apps Script. So, CSS and JavaScript needs to be formatted in to HTML.
