# Description

*GoogleDocs.ino* needs to be programmed into *ESP8266* Wi-Fi module using *Arduino IDE*. For this system, the exact model used is *ESP8266 ESP-01*.

On *Google Drive*, a blank *Google Sheets* needs to be created inside it. Then, create a new new script inside the spreadsheet. The *Code.gs* needs to be inserted into the script.

Note that despite using the same spreadsheet, the *Script Projects* for *Communication Unit* **needs to be a separate project** from *Output & Database*.
